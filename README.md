# turkish-programmer-keyboard-layout
It is really hard to write code with turkish keyboard. You have to use shifts and altgr buttons to use basic programming symbols. There is a lot of unused keys in turkish keyboard on coding and if you accidentally use those keys in code and leave it there, some compilers would break and output unusable code. It would also makes your code only readable to turkish people and thats never good. This layout would replace default turkish QWERTY layout for turkish coders. So coding with this a little bit better ^^
